However, Python has unique strengths, charms, and expressivity that can be hard to grasp at first -- as well as hidden pitfalls that can easily trip you up if you aren't aware of them. Effective Python will help you harness the full power of Python to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code. Utilizing the concise, scenario-driven style pioneered in Scott Meyers's best-selling Effective C++, Brett Slatkin brings together 53 Python best practices, tips, shortcuts, and realistic code examples from expert programmers. Through realistic examples, Slatkin uncovers little-known Python quirks, intricacies, and idioms that powerfully impact code behavior and performance. You'll learn how to choose the most efficient and effective way to accomplish key tasks when multiple options exist, and how to write code that's easier to understand, maintain, and improve. Drawing on his deep understanding of Python's capabilities, Slatkin offers practical advice for each major area of development with both Python 3.x and Python 2.x. Coverage includes: * Algorithms * Objects * Concurrency * Collaboration * Built-in modules * Production techniques * And more Each section contains specific, actionable guidelines organized into items, each with carefully worded advice supported by detailed technical arguments and illuminating examples. Using Effective Python, you can systematically improve all the Python code you write: not by blindly following rules or mimicking incomprehensible idioms, but by gaining a deep understanding of the technical reasons why they make sense.""--[Source inconnue].","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780134034287'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0134034287'}]",False,True,227.0,BOOK,['Computers'],,,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Python&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&dq=Python&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Effective_Python.html?hl=&id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"Effective Python will help students harness the full power of Python to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code.",False,False,59 Specific Ways to Write Better Python,,,,,,,,,Python

The goal of data science is to improve decision making through the analysis of data. Today data science determines the ads we see online, the books and movies that are recommended to us online, which emails are filtered into our spam folders, and even how much we pay for health insurance. This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges. It has never been easier for organizations to gather, store, and process data. Use of data science is driven by the rise of big data and social media, the development of high-performance computing, and the emergence of such powerful methods for data analysis and modeling as deep learning. Data science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting non-obvious and useful patterns from large datasets. It is closely related to the fields of data mining and machine learning, but broader in scope. This book offers a brief history of the field, introduces fundamental data concepts, and describes the stages in a data science project. It considers data infrastructure and the challenges posed by integrating data from multiple sources, introduces the basics of machine learning, and discusses how to link machine learning expertise with real-world problems.

Irizarry'],CRC Press,2019-11-20,"Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R introduces concepts and skills that can help you tackle real-world data analysis challenges. It covers concepts from probability, statistical inference, linear regression, and machine learning. It also helps you develop skills such as R programming, data wrangling, data visualization, predictive algorithm building, file organization with UNIX/Linux shell, version control with Git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation. This book is a textbook for a first course in data science. No previous knowledge of R is necessary, although some experience with programming may be helpful. The book is divided into six parts: R, data visualization, statistics with R, data wrangling, machine learning, and productivity tools. Each part has several chapters meant to be presented as one lecture. The author uses motivating case studies that realistically mimic a data scientist’s experience. He starts by asking specific questions and answers these through data analysis so concepts are learned as a means to answering the questions. Examples of the case studies included are: US murder rates by state, self-reported student heights, trends in world health and economics, the impact of vaccines on infectious disease rates, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, election forecasting, building a baseball team, image processing of hand-written digits, and movie recommendation systems. The statistical concepts used to answer the case study questions are only briefly introduced, so complementing with a probability and statistics textbook is highly recommended for in-depth understanding of these concepts. If you read and understand the chapters and complete the exercises, you will be prepared to learn the more advanced concepts and skills needed to become an expert.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000708035'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1000708039'}]",True,True,713.0,BOOK,['Mathematics'],,,NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.2.0.preview.3,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Data+Science&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&dq=Data+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Data_Science.html?hl=&id=xb29DwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This book is a textbook for a first course in data science.

Best of all, Haider teaches a crucial skillset most data science books ignore: how to tell powerful stories using graphics and tables. Every chapter is built around real research challenges, so you’ll always know why you’re doing what you’re doing. You’ll master data science by answering fascinating questions, such as: • Are religious individuals more or less likely to have extramarital affairs? • Do attractive professors get better teaching evaluations? • Does the higher price of cigarettes deter smoking? • What determines housing prices more: lot size or the number of bedrooms? • How do teenagers and older people differ in the way they use social media? • Who is more likely to use online dating services? • Why do some purchase iPhones and others Blackberry devices? • Does the presence of children influence a family’s spending on alcohol? For each problem, you’ll walk through defining your question and the answers you’ll need; exploring how others have approached similar challenges; selecting your data and methods; generating your statistics; organizing your report; and telling your story. Throughout, the focus is squarely on what matters most: transforming data into insights that are clear, accurate, and can be acted upon.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780133991239'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0133991237'}]",True,True,400.0,BOOK,['Business & Economics'],,,NOT_MATURE,True,1.1.1.0.preview.3,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Data+Science&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ,US,FOR_SALE,True,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,Getting Started with Data Science takes its inspiration from worldwide best-sellers like Freakonomics and Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers: It teaches through a powerful narrative packed with unforgettable stories.,False,False,Making Sense of Data with Analytics,31.99,USD,18.49,USD,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-b4YxCwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 31990000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 18490000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'giftable': True}]",http://books.google.com/books/download/Getting_Started_with_Data_Science-sample-epub.acsm?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/download/Getting_Started_with_Data_Science-sample-pdf.acsm?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,Data Science

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

Murphy'],MIT Press,2012-08-24,"A comprehensive introduction to machine learning that uses probabilistic models and inference as a unifying approach. Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics.

Sejnowski'],MIT Press,2018-10-23,"How deep learning—from Google Translate to driverless cars to personal cognitive assistants—is changing our lives and transforming every sector of the economy. The deep learning revolution has brought us driverless cars, the greatly improved Google Translate, fluent conversations with Siri and Alexa, and enormous profits from automated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Deep learning networks can play poker better than professional poker players and defeat a world champion at Go. In this book, Terry Sejnowski explains how deep learning went from being an arcane academic field to a disruptive technology in the information economy. Sejnowski played an important role in the founding of deep learning, as one of a small group of researchers in the 1980s who challenged the prevailing logic-and-symbol based version of AI. The new version of AI Sejnowski and others developed, which became deep learning, is fueled instead by data. Deep networks learn from data in the same way that babies experience the world, starting with fresh eyes and gradually acquiring the skills needed to navigate novel environments. Learning algorithms extract information from raw data; information can be used to create knowledge; knowledge underlies understanding; understanding leads to wisdom. Someday a driverless car will know the road better than you do and drive with more skill; a deep learning network will diagnose your illness; a personal cognitive assistant will augment your puny human brain. It took nature many millions of years to evolve human intelligence; AI is on a trajectory measured in decades. Sejnowski prepares us for a deep learning future.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262038034'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '026203803X'}]",False,True,352.0,BOOK,['Computers'],3.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.1.0.preview.1,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Deep_Learning_Revolution.html?hl=&id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,False,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"Deep learning networks can play poker better than professional poker players and defeat a world champion at Go.

Aggarwal'],Springer,2018-08-25,"This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning. The primary focus is on the theory and algorithms of deep learning. The theory and algorithms of neural networks are particularly important for understanding important concepts, so that one can understand the important design concepts of neural architectures in different applications. Why do neural networks work? When do they work better than off-the-shelf machine-learning models? When is depth useful? Why is training neural networks so hard? What are the pitfalls? The book is also rich in discussing different applications in order to give the practitioner a flavor of how neural architectures are designed for different types of problems. Applications associated with many different areas like recommender systems, machine translation, image captioning, image classification, reinforcement-learning based gaming, and text analytics are covered. The chapters of this book span three categories: The basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines. Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and 8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10. The book is written for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners. Numerous exercises are available along with a solution manual to aid in classroom teaching. Where possible, an application-centric view is highlighted in order to provide an understanding of the practical uses of each class of techniques.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783319944630'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3319944630'}]",True,True,497.0,BOOK,['Computers'],1.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,True,1.1.2.0.preview.3,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=achqDwAAQBAJ,US,FOR_SALE_AND_RENTAL,True,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning.,False,False,A Textbook,79.99,USD,63.99,USD,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-achqDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 79990000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 63990000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'giftable': True}, {'finskyOfferType': 3, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 28000000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 24360000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'rentalDuration': {'unit': 'DAY', 'count': 90}}]",http://books.google.com/books/download/Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning-sample-epub.acsm?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/download/Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning-sample-pdf.acsm?id=achqDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,Deep Learning
